# Javascript-Password-Generator

## Description

This project was made to create a password generator for the client who was looking to create secure and randomly generated passowrds.

## Installation

This project was completed using starter code from gitHub by username friendly-parakeet. It was then improved with html semantics. The only adjustment to code was either the removal of repetative functions, the renaming of divs, or the adjustment of spacing.

## Usage

After cloning the starter code to my computer and into my repository, more JavaScript was created in order to communicate the needs of the client. A new password needed to be created that was between 8 and 128 characters long, inlude lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and special characters, all given options to the user. 

We then see randomly generated passwords provided onto the page.
